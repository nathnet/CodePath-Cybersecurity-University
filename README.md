## Prework

### Requirements

* [x] Set up Burp Suite
* [x] Find a registered user
* [x] Find a password
* [x] Complete the lab

### Notes

The challenge of this assignment for me was to update Burp Suite on my Kali Linux to the latest version by replacing the file in usr/bin rather than installing a new one. Another challenge I faced was to get Burp to connect with the browser and finally capture data packages.
